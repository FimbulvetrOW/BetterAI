The is the source code 
for the DLL 
for the Base DLL Mod
for the game Old World
by Mohawk Games.

To use as-is, put this project into a subfolder of your Old World installation folder.
like this:

Old World\Mod DLL source\repos\BetterAI\BetterAI\BetterAI.csproj

Compiling Release will put a new DLL into Old World\Mod DLL source\ folder.

Only the main branch of the game is supported (same as all other mods I know of).
